/*
Given an n-ary tree, return the level order traversal of its nodes' values. (ie, from left to right, level by level).
For example, given a 3-ary tree:
    We should return its level order traversal:
[
     [1],
     [3,2,4],
     [5,6]
]
  Note:
The depth of the tree is at most 1000.
The total number of nodes is at most 5000.
